# kaprekar-gui
Display how most four digit numbers can be reduced to the same special number

### This is a living document or whatever
I am making this to make coding fun
the utils is the exercise, the gui is what makes it feel real/useful
I will finish this readme when I finish the project
I expect there to be a lot more info eventually

For now, I am going to just use some placeholders

* here's a bullet
```
here's code snippet
```
* next bullet
```python
# a python comment
for ii in range(10):
    '''
    Python block comment
    '''
    if ii % 2 != 0:
        print(f"Uneven number: {ii}")
```
